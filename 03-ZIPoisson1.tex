R Data Analysis Examples: Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression

Zero-inflated poisson regression is used to model count data that has an excess of zero counts. Further, theory suggests that the excess zeros are generated by a separate process from the count values and that the excess zeros can be modeled independently. Thus, the zip model has two parts, a poisson count model and the logit model for predicting excess zeros.
