\begin{itemize}
\item Zero-inflated poisson regression is used to model count data that has an excess of zero counts.
\item Further, theory suggests that the excess zeros are generated by a separate process from the count values and that the excess zeros can be modeled independently.
\item Thus, the zip model has two parts, a poisson count model and the logit model for predicting excess zeros.
\item You may want to review these Data Analysis Example pages, Poisson Regression and Logit Regression.
