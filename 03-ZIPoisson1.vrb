\frametitle{Zero-inflated Poisson regression}
\begin{itemize}
\item Below the model call, you will find a block of output containing Poisson regression coefficients for each of the variables along with standard errors, z-scores, and p-values for the coefficients.
\item A second block follows that corresponds to the inflation model.
\item This includes logit coefficients for predicting excess zeros along with their standard errors, z-scores, and p-values.
\end{itemize}
